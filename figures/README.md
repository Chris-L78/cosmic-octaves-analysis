# Figures Directory

This directory contains all visualizations for the cosmic octaves analysis.

## Included Figures

### 1. Permutation Test Histogram
**File**: `1_permutation_test_histogram.png`

Shows the distribution of strong matches (deviation ≤0.2) from 200,000 random permutations. The red line marks the observed value (3 strong matches), which occurs in only 11 out of 200,000 trials (p=0.000055).

**Key Results**:
- Observed: 3 strong matches
- Expected (random): ~0.12 matches
- p-value: 0.000055 (~3.9σ)

### 2. Structure Ladder Visualization
**File**: `2_structure_ladder.png`

Visual representation of all 15 structures arranged by their characteristic length scale (log₁₀), spanning from protons (10⁻¹⁵ m) to the observable universe (10²⁷ m). Lines connect the 7 canonical octave pairs, color-coded by deviation quality.

**Color Code**:
- Green = Perfect (≤0.05)
- Lime = Excellent (≤0.2)
- Gold = Very Good (≤0.7)
- Orange = Good (≤1.0)
- Red = Fair (>1.0)

### 3. Deviation Summary Bar Chart
**File**: `3_deviation_summary.png`

Bar chart showing the deviation from the ideal ratio (24.0) for each of the 7 octave pairs. Horizontal lines mark quality thresholds.

**Strong Matches (≤0.2)**:
1. Proton → Sun (0.080)
2. C. elegans → Milky Way (0.000) - PERFECT
3. Human → Virgo Supercluster (0.114)

### 4. Ratio Heatmap
**File**: `4_ratio_heatmap.png`

Heatmap showing log₁₀ ratios for all possible structure pairs. The 7 canonical pairs are highlighted with blue boxes. This demonstrates that we're not cherry-picking pairs - we're using a systematic ladder-based pairing rule.

**Color Scale**: Red (far from 24) → Yellow (near 24) → Green (close to 24)

### 5. Delta-Scan Histogram (Look-Elsewhere Correction)
**File**: `5_delta_scan_histogram.png`

Conservative correction addressing the post-hoc nature of choosing Δ=24. Scans delta from 22 to 26 (step 0.05) and records the maximum strong matches at any delta per permutation. Even with this conservative correction, p ≈ 10⁻⁵.

**Key Results**:
- Observed max: 4 strong matches (at Δ≈23.8)
- Empirical p-value: 0.000005
- Conservative upper bound: ~1×10⁻⁵

## How These Figures Were Generated

All figures are generated by running the Python scripts in the `code/` directory:

```bash
cd code
python permutation_test.py    # Generates figures 1, 2, 3, 4
python delta_scan.py           # Generates figure 5
```
